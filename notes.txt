Assigning IP address to Computer and server.
● Creating user and password for the server.
● Run FTP commands

First we will assign the IP address to the Server.
Which is going to be 192.168.1.1
Click on the server and select the Desktop tab and then
click on the IP configuration button.

Now the next step is to set the username and password for
the server. Because you don’t want anyone to login to the
server and access the files.
For example if you are creating a server for the school
then students have limited access and teachers have
access to a lot of things such as exam papers, student
records etc.
So we will create a username and password then we will
also define what type of access this user will have



Double click on the server and select the services tab. On
the left hand menu click on the FTP. here a page will open
where we can set username and password.

in the user name section we can use any username but for
simplicity let’s set the username as admin and the
password also we will set as admin.
Note: Remember the username and password, because it
is going to be used while accessing the files from the
Server


Below this we can choose what kind of access we want to
give to this user.
Here we have options such as:
write-user can add the files to the server and create new
files.
read- user can read the files from the server.
delete= user can delete the files from the server.
rename- user can rename the file
And at last list- user can list down or see all the files
present in the server.
For this user we will select all the options


Once all the setup is done. Click on the add button and
you will be able to see that the user has been created.

——————————————

User is created now we need to set the IP for the computer
and we will be good to go.
Double click on the computer and go to the desktop and
select IP configuration.

——————————

Here we need to set 2 things, one is the IP address and
then the default gateway. Which is going to be the IP
address of the Server.

——————————
We have our server and client ready.
Now open the terminal of the computer. We are going to
run the file transfer commands.
Close the current window and then open the command
prompt.
———————————
from pc cmd prompt
-------------------
First we will login to the server.
Run the command as ftp 192.168.1.1
Ftp is the command and later is the IP address of the
server.
Now the computer will ask for the username, so write the
username as admin.
Then it will ask for the password

server.This can be done by dir command.

on the server.

We are using copper straight through cable. But to connect
2 computers directly we need to use crossover cable.

Here we have a LAN. 4 computers are connected with a
switch.
But we are not able to see the mac address table in the
switch.

To connect the switch and the PC we use copper straight
through cable.
But to connect
